The main building, FOI 1, is a beautiful historical building dating from the 17th century, which makes it the oldest of all faculty buildings of the University of Zagreb.
Its location is superb – just overlooking Varaždin’s Main Square.
Although occupying historical walls, the classrooms and laboratories inside the FOI1 building are equipped with modern technology needed to perform quality instruction.
The FOI International Office, ECTS Coordinator’s office, Office for Student Affairs and most of the lecturers’ offices are situated in the FOI 1 building.
This building also serves as a venue for most events we organize during the year.
